Disk | Persistence | Memory

- Databases
--  Databases are programs that either use disk or memory to do 2 core things:
    record data and query data. In gerneral, they are themselves are servers
    that are long lived and interact with the rest of the appliction through
    network calls, with protocols on top of the TCP or even HTTP.
--  Some databases only keep records in memory, and the users of such databases
    are aware of the fact that those records may be lost forever if the machine
    or process dies
--  For most though, databases need persistence of those records, and thus cannot 
    use memory. This means that you have to write your data to disk. Anything 
    written to disk will remain through power or loss of network partitions, so
    that's what is used to keep permanent records.
--  Since machines die often in a large scale system, special disk partitions or
    volumes are used by the database processes, and those volumes can get
    recovered even if the machine were to go down permanently.

- Disk
--  Usually refers to either HDD (hard-disk drive) or SSD (solid-state drive). 
    Data written to disk will persist  through power failures and general
    machine crashes Disk is also referred to as non-volatile storage.
--  SSD is far faster than HDD (see latencies of accessing data from SSD and
    HDD) but also far more expensive from a financial point of view. Because
    of that, HDD will typically be ysed for datat that is rarely accessed or 
    updated, but that's stored for a long time, and SSD will be used for data
    that's frequently accessed or updated.

- Memory
--  Short for Random Access Memory (RAM). Data stored in memory will be lost
    when the process that has written that data dies.

- Persistent storage
--  Usually refers to disk, but in general it is any form of storage that 
    persists if the process in charge managing it dies.
